learned a new VScode shortcut, multi-line cursor edit. place my cursor anywhere as much as I want and make multiple edits at the same time.  very neat!

Each section should be 100% width and most of the content 70% width of the section.  Can't figure out how to set it. So far, tried width: 70% with CSS

I am going to try to layout one section with only flexboxes.  Took a picture into Inkscape to draw boxes around the content.  First section has 5 boxes.
