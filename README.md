learned a new VScode shortcut, multi-line cursor edit. place my cursor anywhere as much as I want and make multiple edits at the same time. very neat!

Each section should be 100% width and most of the content 70% width of the section. Can't figure out how to set it. So far, tried width: 70% with CSS

I am going to try to layout one section with only flexboxes. Took a picture into Inkscape to draw boxes around the content. First section has 5 boxes.

justify-content: center; was not working and I did not understand why. Finally, I tried align-items: center; and it worked exactly how I imagined. Broke down the problem into a bite size chunk, and found the step that got me over the threshold.

Vscode shortcut: delete line (ctrl + shift + k)

Section two had a div wrapped around each image with text underneath. Flex wrap and a defined width allowed this to happen.

Almost forgot about inline style for HTML tags. Saves a few lines in the style.css file.
